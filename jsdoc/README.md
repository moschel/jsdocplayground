=======

This is pre-release software, under active development. It is not
intended for general use.

Install
-------

To build the jsdoc jar that runs JSDoc 3, use the ant build tool.

    $ cd JSDoc
    $ ant

This will create a file name `jsdoc.jar` in the project base
directory.

To test that the installed app is working, execute the following:

	$ java -jar jsdoc.jar -T

Usage
-----

This example assumes your working directory is the JSDoc project
base directory...

    $ java -jar jsdoc.jar -d stdout yourSourceCode.js

For help regarding the supported commandline options use -h.

	$ java -jar jsdoc.jar -h
